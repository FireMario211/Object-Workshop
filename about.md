# Object Workshop
This mod was made with most of the hard work done by me! <cp>Firee</c>!
Thank you to <cj>Midair</c> for the mod idea, <cy>Alphalaneous</c> for the extra mod ui design / feedback, and <cy>Zidnes</c> for creating the ui concept!

<cy>Additionally, thank you to these people for helping test the mod!</c>

# How to use
- Simply open <cb>the editor</c> and navigate to the next page! There you should see a <cy>folder with a C+</c>.
- Click on the folder and you should be in the <cy>Object Workshop</c> if you already authenticated before! If not, it will ask you for authentication!
- To upload, make sure that the object you want to upload is in your <co>custom objects</c> (C). Otherwise, you won't be able to <cy>upload an object</c>!

# Notice
Currently, if you have the <cb>Happy Textures</c> mod, there is a bug which will cause the <cy>Object Workshop</c> popup to crash if you have the <cy>CCScale9Sprite Fix</c> setting enabled. Ensure that you <cg>disable this</c> if you plan to use this mod with <cb>Happy Textures</c>.

# Authentication Methods
- <cp>DashAuth</c> is an authentication method that <cy>sends a message to a bot</c> to confirm the authenticity of your <cy>GD account</c>, similar to how mods like <cb>Globed</c> handles verifying your <cy>GD account</c>. Unfortunately, RobTop's servers <cr>IP banned my server</c>, meaning this method <cr>is not available</c>.
- <cg>GDAuth</c> is an authentication method made by <cg>fig</c> which <cy>sends your GJP</c> (session token for GD) to <cg>fig's server</c> to confirm the authenticity of your <cy>GD account</c>. You should only use this <cy>if you trust fig's server</c>, as this method is like sending your GD account to <cy>fig's server</c>.
- <cy>Do Later</c> is what it says. This will close the menu and open up the <cy>Object Workshop</c>. Although do note that you <cy>will be limited</c> in what features you can use.

If none of the methods satisfy you, or you would like to receive an <cy>authentication token</c> without doing any of these methods, consider <cy>joining the Discord server</c> to ask me to verify you and give an <cy>authentication token</c> to you.

# Rules for submitting Custom Objects
1. Do not <cy>upload spam, duplicate, or useless objects.</c>
2. Do not upload <cy>any stolen art</c>, objects that <cy>violate copyright</c>, or objects <cy>without the creators permission.</c>
3. Do not upload objects that relate to anything that is <cy>inappropriate, explicit, sexual, or violent.</c>
4. Use an <cy>appropriate name, and tags</c> when uploading.

Breaking these rules will result in a <cr>temporary ban</c>, and possibly a <cr>permanent one</c> if <cy>too severe or repeated.</c>

I hope you enjoy this mod!
